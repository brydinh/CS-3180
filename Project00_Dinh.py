def find_words(letters)
'''
    CONTRACT: find-words : letters -> String
    PURPOSE: Returns a string of comma delimited dictionary words 7
    letters long and in alphabetical order that can be composed of
    characters in letters. (anagrams of letters) There is no trailing
    comma after the last word in the returned string.
    Each letter in letters may only be used once per match, e.g.
    (find-words '("zymomin" "am")) could return "mammoni, zymomin"
    because "mammoni" is composed of letters in letters including the
    three 'm' characters in letters, and "zymomin" is similarly composed of
    letters in letters. However, "mammomi" could not be
    returned because "mammomi" requires four 'm' characters and
    only three are available in letters.
