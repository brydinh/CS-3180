	- I found lambda functions to be very interesting as you can cut 50 lines of java code into 1 racket line. Simplifies code by a lot. 

[1 point] Identify one topic covered by the course that you found most confusing or least informative.

[1 point] Provide constructive feedback regarding the assignments for the course. There is no wrong answer as long as the feedback contains specific recommendations.
	
	- The assignments are fair for the course. The only gripe I had was with the grading. The requirements are not specific in the assignments. For example, I missed points on the on the syntax of a do-while loop. The requirement does not state anywhere we had to follow the syntax of a do-while loop. Next time you need to state that the syntax needs to follow specific guidelines or you will get varied answers.
