	- The assignments are fair for the course. The only gripe I had was with the grading. The requirements are NOT specific in the assignments. For example, I missed points on the on the syntax of a do-while loop. The requirement states to implement a do-while loop. It does not state anywhere we needed to follow the ACTUAL syntax of a do-while loop. Next time you need to state that the syntax needs to follow specific guidelines or you will get varied answers.
